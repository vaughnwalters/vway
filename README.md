# vway // a vegan friendly restaurant finder

https://vway-aff34.firebaseapp.com/

This is a CRUD app used for finding vegan restaurants around the US.  Once added to favorites, the restaurant can be commented on, emailed, or deleted from favorites. VWAY uses angular.js for the front end framework, firebase for user storage, and a node.js proxy server to handle the the API calls, install a factual driver, and to allow CORS for factual and google places.  I used Angular.js, Firebase, Firebase hosting, Materialize, Node.js, and gulp.
